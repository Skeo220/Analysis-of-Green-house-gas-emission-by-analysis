# Analysis-of-Green-house-gas-emission-by-analysis
This comprehensive analysis delves into the intricate landscape of greenhouse gas emissions in 236 countries, utilizing a dataset obtained from Kaggle. 
The primary objective of this study was to discern both the disparities and resemblances in emission patterns across these nations. 
To achieve this, a cluster analysis was meticulously conducted, successfully revealing the presence of 2 distinct clusters among the countries.

For a more detailed exploration of our findings, insights, and methodologies, kindly refer to the Python notebook provided above. 
This notebook offers a comprehensive overview of the entire analysis, enabling a deeper understanding of the intricacies in greenhouse gas emissions and their implications for the international community.

**I plan to release a part 2 for this project shortly because this dataset contains so many valuable insights.**
